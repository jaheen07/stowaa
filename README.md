1. For database,you don't have to migrate all the database inside of the project. Just check "database.rar" file in this repository.extract the file in it. And import the "glice(1).sql" file into your phpmyadmin.

2. The "Stowaa" project requires google APIs, stripe APIS, facebook APIs,github APIs, which is not provided into this repository. For those API's secret key and other keys, please contact with me via email --> "me.zacron@gmail.com" .
